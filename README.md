# BuildingEnergyEfficiency

The RMarkdown file contains exploration of building energy data found on [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Energy+efficiency). The aim was to predict residential buildings' energy consumption (i.e., heating and cooling loads) to enable more energy efficient designs. The models attempted included regressions (multivariate, stepwise, Lasso, and Ridge), bagging, random forest, and boosting, with boosting yielding the best RMSE for both the heating load model and the cooling load.
