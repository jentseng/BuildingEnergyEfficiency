# BuildingEnergyEfficiency

The RMarkdown file contains our exploration of building energy data found on [https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Energy+efficiency](UCI Machine Learning Repository). We aimed to predict residential buildings' energy consumption (i.e., heating and cooling loads) to enable more energy efficient designs. The models we tried included regressions (multivariate, stepwise, Lasso, and Ridge), bagging, random forest, and boosting, with boosting yielding the best RMSE for both the heating load model and the cooling load.
